Hi! My name is Lincoln Alexander. I’m currently a senior at University Central Florida studying Computer Science. I am highly passionate about software engineering, and problem-solving, and have a pure devotion to technology and development 👨🏽‍💻
I created this portfolio website to show my projects and contributions. I am passionate about building web applications and giving each and every user fulfillment and ease as they interact with the application.
